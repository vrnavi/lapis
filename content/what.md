This site is my personal Outernet web page, graciously hosted by the Community of Starry Point and constructed with the help of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and broadcast with the help of the [NETeSCAPE](https://netescape.org) Innernet Self Beacon. If you live in the Innernet, please come and say hi, I welcome visitors at all times.

For any prospective reading this that are confused on what the hell I just said, don't worry about it, it doesn't apply to you. All you really need to know is that the Outernet is roughly equivalent to the common term of the Internet.

Don't think too much about it. You probably won't be visiting Starry Point anyway.
