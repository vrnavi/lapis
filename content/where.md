I host this site on GitHub Pages, since getting consistent routing to and from the Starry Point Lighthouse is a pain. I could do it from the Tunnelvision Arcade, but I already have enough power hungry cabinets in there as it is.

If you're asking where I live, you can find me at the Starry Point Lighthouse on the Innernet. If you're asking for physical location, go away. I don't take kindly to creeps. Unless you show up with alcohol, in which case, email me. (Don't.)

The other places you can find me in the Outernet Expanse are as follows:
- Discord: `renavi#6900`
- Twitter: `now dead.`
- Mastodon: `soon, will also add to footer.`

And my work site at [whistler.page](https://whistler.page).

It will say it's run by Systemware, don't tell them. I want to see how long I can mess with it before they find out.
