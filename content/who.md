I am **Lapis.** I also go by `Ren` (renavi) as an online username. I predominantly write and worldbuild, but I sometimes do other things if I feel like it.

Outside of writing, I study Japanese. I wish to be a translator at some point in my life. An eventuality.

Lover of:
- Retro consoles.
- Y2K aesthetic.
- Shitposting.
- The Starry Point Lighthouse.

*My real name will never be posted on this site. I'm sure you could figure it out if you really wanted to, though..*

Either way, nice to meet you.
